1.When we want to initialize the data member variables or want to pass some variables at the time of class instantiation using a
paramterized are good option. However whenever a constructor is overridden there must be a defination of default constrctor. So when you
have not defined any default constrctor and try to pass parameters to derived class as well as you want to invoke the base class
parameterized constructor so must call it explicitly along with the dervied class constructor.
